Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
1. Node.js and npm are installed on your development machine.
2. Expo CLI or React Native CLI installed globally.

Usage
----------------
On the first launch, users will be presented with an onboarding screen.
After onboarding, a splash screen will be shown while the app loads.
Users will then be taken to the home page displaying recipe categories.
Tapping on a category navigates to a list of recipes within that category.
Selecting a specific recipe opens the recipe details screen, including ingredients, instructions, and a cooking video.

The app provides a visually pleasing and responsive user interface.
